# Project_Euler

> Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics.

## [About](https://projecteuler.net/)

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

> The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

Personally, I use the problems provided by Project Euler during my initial exploration of a programming language. I find that the problems provided help me to play with the languages syntax, to see what works and what doesn't work. In doing this, I feel that the speed at which I gain an understanding of the language's syntax is accelerated.
